# augur-core

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AugurProject/augur-core.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/AugurProject/augur-core)

Ethereum contracts for a decentralized prediction market platform.

## Installation

You should already have a system-wide installation of Python and it should be Python 2.7.

First install the dependencies, which include PyEthereum (the tool used to test Ethereum smart contracts from Python scripts) and the Solidity smart contract programming language:

```
npm install -g solc

sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On macOS you will need to use a
[virtualenv](https://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) or use a [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) Python to work around System Integrity Protection.

Now we can try running some tests to make sure our installation worked:

```
cd tests
python runtests.py
```

## Docker

You may run augur-core using docker as follows:

### Build:

```
docker image build --tag augur-core-tests --file Dockerfile-test .
```

### Run:

```
docker container run --rm -it augur-core-tests
```

### Debug:

```
docker container run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/bash augur-core-tests
py.test -s tests/trading_tests.py
```

## Terminology

[Augur Terminology](http://blog.augur.net/faq/all-terms/)

## Src Folders

The source code folders are split into six folders: extensions, factories, libraries, reporting, and trading. Splitting the folders this way allows for a separation of concerns and better modularity.
- src/extensions -- contains files that deal with market creation, bond validity, getting the market price and reporting fee in attoeth (10^-18 eth), creating order books, reporting messages, and getting free REP (reputationTokens)
- src/factories -- contains files that are constructors for branches, markets, reputation Tokens, reporting Periods/Windows, tradeable asset shareTokens, and topics for prediction.
- src/libraries -- contains data structures used elsewhere in the source code.
- src/reporting -- contains source files for the creation and manipulation of branches, markets, and various types of tokens (registration Tokens, reporting Tokens, and reputation Tokens).
- src/trading -- contains source code files that handle user actions regarding orders, claims, topics, and other trade functions.

## Security model

The security model is based on the idea that reporters will want to invest in a market where honesty prevails, and will not trust fraudulent markets. For example, assume that there exist two almost identical universes: an honest universe, where the factually correct answer is the predominant answer, and a fraudulent universe, where incorrect answers are predominant in order to cheat the system. The REP in the fraudulent universe will approach 0, and the REP in the honest universe will approach the theoretical yield. This phenomenon occurs because reporters do not want to trade on markets in a dishonest universe. Therefore, they will not create markets in a dishonest universe. Ultimately, the REP holders will not receive any market fees.

In order to create a fraudulent universe, an attacker must fork the main branch. They will need to buy a large share of REP and stake it on the lie outcome, as nobody else will want to engage in a deceitful market. In principle, the attacker will lose up to 2.5 times the maximum profit made from a successful attack, and their REP will approach 0.

The reentrancy guard (libraries/ReentrancyGuard.sol) and controller (Controller.sol) contracts also help uphold security. One can also attack Ethereum contracts by creating a chain of wanted contract calls through a malicious user. The mutex contract prevents against that by preventing someone from re-entering the contracts before they return. The controller contract serves to update Augur and stores a registry of whitelisted contract addresses. The controller also can perform administrative actions, such as transferring ownership and performing emergency stop functions. It can be operated in either the developer mode, where the developer updates contracts, or the decentralized mode, when people must upload contracts to make changes and therefore, the market creators/traders must cancel orders and shift to the new contract. For bugs found involving money or REP, contracts are locked / an escape hatch is enabled which allows withdrawal of shares [and cancelling orders] for a value half-way between the bid-ask spread at the time of the lock. In addition, another escape hatch is enabled, which allows withdrawal of any locked up REP.

## Testing

The tests directory (augur-core/tests) contain tests and test fixtures to test the various functionalities present in Augur, including trading, reporting, and wcl tests.
- conftest.py -- contains the class ContractFixture, which deals with caching compiled contracts, signatures, etc. as well as resetting the blockchain before each test.
- delegation_sandbox.py -- tests the delegator contract.
- sandbox.py -- used for testing miscellaneous Solidity behaviors
- reporting -- contains tests for reporting purposes.
- trading -- contains tests for trading purposes.
- solidity_test_helpers -- small contracts to help run tests.
- test_controller.py -- tests controller functionalities.
- test_mutex.py -- tests mutex functionalities.
- test_helpers.py -- tests the controller, safeMath, and assertNoValue macros.
- test_legacyRep.py -- tests the legacyRepTokens’ functionalities.
- utils.py -- contains useful functions for testing, such as conversion between different data types.
- wcl-in-python.py -- contains functions for making and taking various types of bids.
- wcl.txt -- explains tests for the various situations when filling a bid and filling an ask.

In order to run Augur’s test suite, run the following inside the tests directory:
```
cd augur-core/tests
pytest
```
This executes all the tests. To run a test individually, run the following:
```
pytest path/to/test_file.py -k 'name_of_test’
```

By default the trading WCL fuzz testing is not run, if you want to run it specifically do
```
export INCLUDE_FUZZY_TESTS=1
pytest trading/test_wcl_fuzzy.py
unset INCLUDE_FUZZY_TESTS
```

Or if you want to run all tests (including fuzzy):

```
export INCLUDE_FUZZY_TESTS=1
pytest
unset INCLUDE_FUZZY_TESTS
```

When writing tests, it is highly recommended to make use of the ContractFixtures class for ‘placeholder’ variables. Python’s unit testing framework comes handy here; encapsulate tests within functions that start with “test_”, and use “assert” statements when testing for certain values. Parameterized tests are recommended as well to test various possibilities and edge cases.

## Additional notes

There are no floats in the EVM.

All augur-core contracts use integers. So ether values in contracts will always be represented as integers whose value is in attoeth (aka: wei, 10^-18 ether).
